// Harvester V2
//
// Body: 6x WORK and 1x MOVE
//
// This harvester is designed to work like this:
// 1. (Manually?) Build a container adjacent to an energy source
// 2. This harvester, at initialization time, will loop
//    through all harvesters and find which sources other
//    harvesters are assigned to.
// 3. It will pick a source with no other harvesters, and
//    save it in its memory.
// 4. It will search for the adjacent container to the selected
//    source, and go there. (And save it in the memory.)
// 5. It will start harvesting, and since it has no CARRY, it will
//    just drop into the container at that point.
// 6. It sits there until it dies.
//
// Three WORK modules will allow the harvester to get six energy per
// tick. Since energy respawns every 300 ticks to 3,000, we can get
// 3,600 energy out during this time, giving us a buffer of 60 ticks
// to respawn when a harvester dies.

// This is designed to work with two other types of creeps.
// fetcher - Moves energy to Storage from Containers (and on the ground)
// filler  - Take energy from Storage (or Containers if no storage)
//           and puts to tower, extensions and spawn

// CORNER CASES
// 1. If sources are almost adjacent, this could present a difficulty.
// 2. If another creep is standing on our container, we'll just wait.
// 3. If the container is destroyed or removed, we'll just harvest onto
//    the ground, so make sure the fetcher will pick stuff up off the
//    ground occasionally. The next harvester will just not do anything.
// 4. When we can't have containers yet (too low a RoomController Level),
//    we need to use our old style harvesters.

// MEMORY ITEMS
// home_room: NAME of the room this harvester lives in
// source_id: ID of the source this harvester harvests
// container_id: ID of the container this harvester stands on
// container_x/y: x, y position of the location this harvester stands on
// in_position: boolean saying whether we're ready to harvest
// initialized: boolean saying if we have set all the above variables

// TODO: Add a bootstrapping mode where if we can't build our maximum
// size bodies harvester2, filler, transfer, then we just build size
// 300 until we have at least one of each so we can build as big as
// we possibly could.
// This will need to modify the spawn_body with a lot more logic.



// Assume this is called only once, and sets initialized at the end.
// Returns true if we succeed, or false on any error.
//
// Go through every source, and every adjacent container to every
// source, and pick one nobody else has taken.
//
// NOTE: THIS MUST MATCH CALCULATIONS IN resources.count_source_containers()!!!
