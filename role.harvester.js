// Harvester priorities:
// 1. Load up its carry capacity
// 2. Deliver it to a spawn, extension or tower, or container/storage
// 3. Otherwise deliver it to Room Controller

// TODO: Ensure that creeps spread themselves between all available
// sources equally, if possible. The "id" method doesn't seem to
// be working very well.
//
// One idea: Assign each creep a preferred source at spawn time,
// based upon counting the preferred source for each source in
// the room, and giving it to the one with the least.
// As a further optimization, calculate the number of spots
// adjacent to the source and balance based upon that.

// TODO: Only transfer to TOWER if the tower is less than
// 90% full. Or, let towers have memory that says if they
// need energy and we can check that. Every tick they can
// set their energy needed memory at the beginning. This
// way they could set it at below 90% and reset it above
// 98% (or whatever).
