// that disappears, still go there anyway, until we know for sure

// This will cover the case where, for example, an enemy comes into
// a remote harvesting room and kills all our creeps (or they all
// run away) but we then keep sending more creeps there.

// last_enemy_tick - when we last saw any enemies

// TODO:
// Don't spawn defenders in rooms where we have towers, the towers have
// at least a few hundred energy, and the enemies in those rooms are Invaders.
